/**
 * Dev-only full-bleed phone frame for screen stories (e.g. the Home-Cleaning funnel and the
 * post-checkout Thank-You screen). NOT part of the public API — it's preview infrastructure, not a
 * shipped component, so it lives in `_dev/` and isn't re-exported from `index.ts`.
 *
 * A `position: fixed` full-screen wrapper that fills the viewport so a screen behaves like a real
 * device: the screen's own inner scroll owns the gesture and the frame itself never moves — except to
 * follow the iOS soft keyboard.
 *
 * Why measure the visual viewport at all? Two iOS-standalone ("Add to Home Screen") quirks:
 *
 * 1. First-paint bottom bug — a `position:fixed; bottom:0` element resolves its bottom against the
 *    **layout viewport**, which is ~40px SHORT of the true visual viewport until the first scroll
 *    forces a reflow, so on open the floating bottom bar sat ~40px too high and only dropped into place
 *    after a scroll. We therefore drive the no-keyboard height from CSS — the `[data-phone-frame]` rule
 *    in `preview-head.html` (`height:100vh; height:100dvh`), a cascade RNW's single inline value can't
 *    express: `100vh` keeps the wrapper full-screen even without `dvh` (iOS < 15.4, where a lone
 *    `100dvh` is dropped and the fixed element collapses to content height); `100dvh` overrides on
 *    supporting engines to reach the PHYSICAL bottom *under* the home indicator for full bottom bleed
 *    (`viewport-fit=cover`). `visualViewport.height` EXCLUDES that home-indicator strip on a standalone
 *    iOS app — which left the floating bar hovering with a gap — so we deliberately do NOT use it for
 *    the no-keyboard height (no inline height in that state ⇒ the CSS rule wins).
 * 2. Keyboard — when the iOS keyboard opens it both shrinks the visual viewport AND scrolls the page,
 *    but `position:fixed` follows the *layout* viewport, so bottom sheets appeared to fly to the top.
 *    ONLY when the keyboard is up do we pin the wrapper to the *measured* visual-viewport height (an
 *    inline height that overrides the CSS rule) and translate by `offsetTop`, re-pinning it over the
 *    visible area and keeping a sheet anchored just above the keyboard.
 *
 * We re-measure as the standalone viewport settles (a rAF, staged ticks, and viewport/resize/
 * orientation events) so the bottom edge lands correctly on first paint. `data-phone-frame` (set via
 * RNW's `dataSet`) is what the CSS rule targets.
